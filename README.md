# Football Match Prediction Model

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model using XGBoost to predict football match outcomes. The model will be trained on historical football match data, with a focus on using statistics from up to 5 years prior to predict matches from the 2023-2024 season.

## Data Source
The data is sourced from the [English Premier League & Championship Full Dataset] from KAGGLE (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/panaaaaa/english-premier-league-and-championship-full-dataset/data) which provides comprehensive statistics for football matches across EPL and seasons.

## Features
The model will take into account various features including team performance, player statistics, historical head-to-head results, and more.

## Dataset Description

### Initial Dataset Columns

1. **Date**: The date when the match was played
2. **Season**: The football season in which the match took place (usually spans across two years, e.g., 2023-24)
3. **HomeTeam**: The team playing at their home stadium
4. **AwayTeam**: The visiting team
5. **FTH Goals**: Full Time Home Goals (total goals scored by home team at the end of the match)
6. **FTA Goals**: Full Time Away Goals (total goals scored by away team at the end of the match)
7. **FT Result**: Full Time Result (typically shown as H for home win, A for away win, D for draw)
8. **HTH Goals**: Half Time Home Goals (goals scored by home team at half-time)
9. **HTA Goals**: Half Time Away Goals (goals scored by away team at half-time)
10. **HT Result**: Half Time Result (H for home team leading, A for away team leading, D for draw at half-time)
11. **Referee**: Name of the match official/referee
12. **H Shots**: Total shots attempted by the home team
13. **A Shots**: Total shots attempted by the away team
14. **H SOT**: Home Shots on Target (shots by home team that were on goal)
15. **A SOT**: Away Shots on Target (shots by away team that were on goal)
16. **H Fouls**: Number of fouls committed by the home team
17. **A Fouls**: Number of fouls committed by the away team
18. **H Corners**: Corner kicks awarded to the home team
19. **A Corners**: Corner kicks awarded to the away team
20. **H Yellow**: Yellow cards shown to home team players
21. **A Yellow**: Yellow cards shown to away team players
22. **H Red**: Red cards shown to home team players
23. **A Red**: Red cards shown to away team players
24. **Display_Order**: A numerical ordering system for displaying the matches (likely used for sorting or presentation purposes)
25. **League**: The competition or league in which the match was played

## Feature Engineering
Additional features will be created based on the initial dataset, including:
- Team form (recent performance)
- Historical head-to-head results
- Seasonal performance metrics
- Advanced statistics derived from the raw data

## Model
The project uses XGBoost, a gradient boosting framework that is efficient and provides state-of-the-art results for many machine learning problems.

## Evaluation
The model will be evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification tasks.

## Usage
Instructions for running the model and making predictions will be added as the project develops.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Required packages will be listed in requirements.txt
